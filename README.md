This is the repository for PLOD Dataset submitted to LREC 2022. The dataset can help build sequence labelling models for the task Abbreviation Detection. 

### Dataset

We provide two variants of our dataset - Filtered and Unfiltered. They are described in our paper here.

1. The Filtered version can be accessed via [Huggingface Datasets here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/surrey-nlp/PLOD-filtered) and a CONLL format is present here in the data folder.<br/>

2. The Unfiltered version can be accessed via [Huggingface Datasets here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/surrey-nlp/PLOD-unfiltered) and a CONLL format is present here in the data folder.<br/>

3. The [SDU Shared Task](https://sites.google.com/view/sdu-aaai22/home) data we use for zero-shot testing is [available here](https://github.com/amirveyseh/AAAI-22-SDU-shared-task-1-AE).

### Installation

We use the custom NER pipeline in the [spaCy transformers](https://spacy.io/universe/project/spacy-transformers) library to train our models. This library supports training via any pre-trained language models available at the :rocket: [HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/).<br/>
Please see the instructions at these websites to setup your own custom training with our dataset to reproduce the experiments using Spacy.

OR<br/>

However, you can also reproduce the experiments via the Python notebook we [provide here](https://github.com/surrey-nlp/PLOD-AbbreviationDetection/blob/main/nbs/fine_tuning_abbr_det.ipynb) which uses HuggingFace Trainer class to perform the same experiments. The exact hyperparameters can be obtained from the models readme cards linked below. Before starting, please perform the following steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/surrey-nlp/PLOD-AbbreviationDetection
cd PLOD-AbbreviationDetection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, you can use the notebook to reproduce the experiments.

### Model(s)


Our best performing models are hosted on the HuggingFace models repository

| Models | [`PLOD - Unfiltered`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/surrey-nlp/PLOD-unfiltered) | [`PLOD - Filtered`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/surrey-nlp/PLOD-filtered) | Description |

On the link provided above, the model(s) can be used with the help of the Inference API via the web-browser itself. We have placed some examples with the API for testing.<br/>

### Usage

You can use the HuggingFace Model link above to find the instructions for using this model in Python locally using the notebook provided in the Git repo.
